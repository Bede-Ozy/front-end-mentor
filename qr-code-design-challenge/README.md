## My process
- I created a container for the card and gave it a width and height
- Then added the image tag inside this container and applied a 100% width to take the full width of its container.
- i then applied a font size and family on the body tag
- added a flex display and gave it a column orientation to stack elements vertically
- in the qr-card i increased the font size of the title text and made it bold 
- created a universal selector to apply a margin to all elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'ld focus on improving my semantics and positioning of elements on the browser
